# grahpql-fs-cardio

A training purposed project that uses HLTV npm package to get CS GO news and match results.

express server is listening at :5000 and in GQ Schema app is targeting the same port as a source, /allmatches is not working at the moment due to npm package caused problems(I guess), that problem will be fixed in the future.

I'll add frontend with react and apollo-graphql soon.
